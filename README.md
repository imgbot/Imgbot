# Imgbot

Imgbot crawls all your image files in GitHub and submits pull requests after applying a loss less compression.
This will make the file size go down, but leave the dimensions and quality just as good.

## Configuration

Imgbot supports optional configuration through a `.imgbotconfig` json file.
This is not a required step to using Imgbot and is only for more advanced scenarios.
This file should be placed in the root of the repository and set to your liking.

```jsonc
{
    "schedule": "daily", // daily|weekly|monthly
    "ignoredFiles": [
    	"*.jpg",                   // by extension
    	"image1.png",              // by filename
    	"public/special_images/*", // by folderpath
    ],
    "aggressiveCompression": "true", // true|false
    "compressWiki": "true", // true|false
    "minKBReduced": 500 // set reduction threshold (default to 10),
    "prTitle" : "Compressed images", // set pull request title
    // set the pull request body, supports any valid github markdown
    // {optimization_ratio} display a message containing the optimization ratio
    // {optimization_details} display the table containing the optimization details
    "prBody" : " Text before optimization ratio {optimization_ratio} Text after optimization ratio 
                Text before optimization details {optimization_details} Text after optimization details",
    
}
```

The following are the currently supported parameters.
If there are any configuration settings you would like to see changed or supported,
please feel free to open an issue here in the repo or shoot an email over
to help@imgbot.net

**schedule**

- Optional
- Accepts: daily|weekly|monthly
- Limits the PRs from Imgbot to once a day, once a week, or once a month respectively
- The default behavior is to receive Imgbot PRs as images require optimization

**ignoredFiles**

- Optional
- Accepts the syntax for searchPattern on [Directory.EnumerateFiles()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.directory.enumeratefiles)
- Limits the images optimized by Imgbot by essentially ignoring them
- When ignoring by file name no path is necessary, when ignoring by folder name full path from root is necessary

**aggressiveCompression**

- Optional
- Accepts: true|false
- Opt in to use lossy compression algorithms
- The default behaviour without this setting is loss less compression

**compressWiki**

- Optional
- Accepts: true|false
- Opt in to also compress wiki repo
    - Example: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.wiki.git`
- The default behaviour is opt out


**minKBReduced**

- Optional
- Accepts only numbers as input (e.g. `"minKBReduced": 500` for a 500 KB threshold)
- Can be used to limit the frequency of PRs Imgbot will open over time
- The default setting is 10

**prTitle**

- Optional
- Available only for paid plans
- Accepts only strings as input (e.g. `"prTitle": "My title"`)
- Can be used to display any custom pull request title
- The default setting is "[ImgBot] Optimize images"

**prBody**

- Optional
- Available only for paid plans
- Accepts only strings as input 
- (e.g. `"prBody": "Text before  {optimization_ratio} Text after"` <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     `Text before  {optimization_details} Text after"`)
- Can be used to display any custom pull request body, written using github [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- Supports two magic tags: `{optimization_ratio} //displays the mean optimization ratio for all images` <br /> 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `{optimization_details} //display the optimization details for every images`
- The default setting generates the body displayed [here](https://imgbot.net/images/screen.png?cache=2)
